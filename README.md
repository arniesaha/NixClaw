# NixClaw

> Forked from [VisionClaw](https://github.com/sseanliu/VisionClaw)

![NixClaw](assets/teaserimage.png)

A multi-mode AI assistant — through Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses, iPhone camera, or just voice. See what you see, hear what you say, and take actions on your behalf.

![Cover](assets/cover.png)

Built on [Meta Wearables DAT SDK](https://github.com/facebook/meta-wearables-dat-ios) + [Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live) + [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw).

## Features

- 🎙️ **Real-time voice** — Bidirectional audio via Gemini Live (native audio, not speech-to-text)
- 👓 **Smart glasses** — See through Meta Ray-Ban camera, respond in real-time
- 📱 **iPhone camera** — Visual AI without glasses
- 🔊 **Audio-only mode** — Voice conversations with AirPods, speakers, or built-in mic
- 🔧 **Action execution** — Messaging, web search, smart home, notes, and more via OpenClaw
- 🏃 **Background mode** — Conversation continues when you lock your phone or switch apps
- 🏝️ **Live Activity** — Session status on lock screen and Dynamic Island
- ⚙️ **Configurable** — xcconfig for builds, in-app settings for runtime changes
- 🧙 **Setup wizard** — First-launch walkthrough, no code editing required

## Backstory

NixClaw started from a conversation with **Nix**, my personal [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agent. I was using VisionClaw to stream video from Meta Ray-Ban glasses to Gemini — great for real-time voice + vision, but it had two key limitations: it had no way to call your agent by name and route actions through a tool call, and it required the app to stay in the foreground at all times.

Meanwhile, Nix could send messages, search the web, manage my lists, control smart home devices, and more — but had no eyes or ears.

NixClaw bridges the two: I added an `execute` tool that lets Gemini call your OpenClaw agent by name, routing actions through the gateway. I also added background audio mode so the conversation keeps running when you lock your phone or switch apps. The name is literally **Nix** + Open**Claw** — the AI assistant that can see, hear, *and* act.

## What It Does

Choose your mode and talk:

- **Smart Glasses** — Gemini sees through your Meta Ray-Ban camera and responds in real-time
- **Audio Only** — Voice conversations with AI using any audio device (AirPods, speakers, built-in mic), continues in background
- **iPhone Camera** — Use your iPhone camera for visual AI without glasses

Example commands:
- **"What am I looking at?"** — Gemini sees through your camera and describes the scene
- **"Add milk to my shopping list"** — delegates to OpenClaw, which adds it via your connected apps
- **"Send a message to John saying I'll be late"** — routes through OpenClaw to WhatsApp/Telegram/iMessage
- **"Search for the best coffee shops nearby"** — web search via OpenClaw, results spoken back

## How It Works

![How It Works](assets/how.png)

**Key pieces:**
- **Gemini Live** — real-time voice + vision AI over WebSocket (native audio, not STT-first)
- **OpenClaw** — local gateway that gives Gemini access to 56+ tools and all your connected apps
- **Three modes** — glasses (video + audio), iPhone camera (video + audio), audio-only (runs in background)

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up OpenClaw

NixClaw is designed to work with an [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agent. Without it, you get voice + vision but no ability to take actions — which is the whole point.

Follow the [OpenClaw setup guide](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) to install and configure your agent. Make sure the gateway is enabled:

In `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "port": 18789,
    "bind": "lan",
    "auth": {
      "mode": "token",
      "token": "your-gateway-token-here"
    },
    "http": {
      "endpoints": {
        "chatCompletions": { "enabled": true }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Key settings:
- `bind: "lan"` — exposes the gateway on your local network so your iPhone can reach it
- `chatCompletions.enabled: true` — enables the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint (off by default)
- `auth.token` — the token your iOS app will use to authenticate

Start the gateway:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

Verify it's running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:18789/health
```

### 2. Clone and open

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arniesaha/NixClaw.git
cd NixClaw
open NixClaw.xcodeproj
```

### 3. Configure

Copy the template config:

```bash
cp Config/NixClaw.xcconfig Config/Nix.xcconfig
```

Edit `Config/Nix.xcconfig` and fill in your values:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY = your-gemini-api-key
DEFAULT_OPENCLAW_SCHEME = http
DEFAULT_OPENCLAW_HOSTNAME = Your-Mac.local
DEFAULT_OPENCLAW_PORT = 18789
DEFAULT_OPENCLAW_TOKEN = your-gateway-token-here
```

Get a free Gemini API key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

To find your Mac's hostname: **System Settings > General > Sharing** — it's shown at the top (e.g., `Johns-MacBook-Pro.local`).

> **Note:** The scheme and hostname are separate because `//` in URLs is interpreted as a comment by the xcconfig parser.

Then in Xcode, set the configuration file: **Project > Info > Configurations > set all to `Nix.xcconfig`**.

Alternatively, skip the xcconfig step — the app will show a setup wizard on first launch where you can enter everything.

### 4. Build and run

Select your iPhone as the target device and hit Run (Cmd+R).

### 5. Try it out

From the home screen, choose your mode:

**Audio Only:**
1. Tap **"Audio Only"** — starts a voice conversation using your current audio device
2. Talk to the AI — no camera needed, keeps running in background

**iPhone Camera:**
1. Tap **"iPhone Camera"** — uses your iPhone's back camera
2. Talk to the AI — it can see through your iPhone camera

**With Meta Ray-Ban glasses:**

First, enable Developer Mode in the Meta AI app:

1. Open the **Meta AI** app on your iPhone
2. Go to **Settings** (gear icon, bottom left)
3. Tap **App Info**
4. Tap the **App version** number **5 times** — this unlocks Developer Mode
5. Go back to Settings — you'll now see a **Developer Mode** toggle. Turn it on.

Then in NixClaw:
1. Tap **"Connect Glasses"** in the app
2. Tap the **AI button** for voice + vision conversation

## Architecture

### Key Files

All source code is in `NixClaw/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Config/AppConfig.swift` | Centralized runtime config (UserDefaults > Info.plist > fallback) |
| `Config/SetupWizardView.swift` | First-launch setup wizard |
| `Config/SettingsView.swift` | Runtime settings UI |
| `Gemini/GeminiConfig.swift` | Model config, system prompt (reads from AppConfig) |
| `Gemini/GeminiLiveService.swift` | WebSocket client for Gemini Live API |
| `Gemini/AudioManager.swift` | Mic capture (PCM 16kHz) + audio playback (PCM 24kHz) |
| `Gemini/GeminiSessionViewModel.swift` | Session lifecycle, tool call wiring, transcript state |
| `OpenClaw/ToolCallModels.swift` | Tool declarations, data types |
| `OpenClaw/OpenClawBridge.swift` | HTTP client for OpenClaw gateway |
| `OpenClaw/ToolCallRouter.swift` | Routes Gemini tool calls to OpenClaw |
| `iPhone/IPhoneCameraManager.swift` | AVCaptureSession wrapper for iPhone camera mode |
| `Background/BackgroundModeManager.swift` | App lifecycle and background mode transitions |

### Audio Pipeline

- **Input**: iPhone mic -> AudioManager (PCM Int16, 16kHz mono, 100ms chunks) -> Gemini WebSocket
- **Output**: Gemini WebSocket -> AudioManager playback queue -> iPhone speaker
- **iPhone mode**: Uses `.voiceChat` audio session for echo cancellation + mic gating during AI speech
- **Glasses mode**: Uses `.videoChat` audio session (mic is on glasses, speaker is on phone — no echo)

### Video Pipeline

- **Glasses**: DAT SDK `videoFramePublisher` (24fps) -> throttle to ~1fps -> JPEG (50% quality) -> Gemini
- **iPhone**: `AVCaptureSession` back camera (30fps) -> throttle to ~1fps -> JPEG -> Gemini

### Tool Calling

Gemini Live supports function calling. This app declares a single `execute` tool that routes everything through OpenClaw:

1. User says "Add eggs to my shopping list"
2. Gemini speaks "Sure, adding that now" (verbal acknowledgment before tool call)
3. Gemini sends `toolCall` with `execute(task: "Add eggs to the shopping list")`
4. `ToolCallRouter` sends HTTP POST to OpenClaw gateway
5. OpenClaw executes the task using its 56+ connected skills
6. Result returns to Gemini via `toolResponse`
7. Gemini speaks the confirmation

## Requirements

- iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Gemini API key ([get one free](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey))
- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) running on your Mac
- Meta Ray-Ban glasses (optional — use iPhone camera or audio-only mode)

## Troubleshooting

**"Gemini API key not configured"** — Enter your API key in the setup wizard or in Settings.

**OpenClaw connection timeout** — Make sure your iPhone and Mac are on the same Wi-Fi network, the gateway is running (`openclaw gateway restart`), and the hostname in your config matches your Mac's Bonjour name.

**Echo/feedback in iPhone mode** — The app mutes the mic while the AI is speaking. If you still hear echo, try turning down the volume.

**Gemini doesn't hear me** — Check that microphone permission is granted. The app uses aggressive voice activity detection — speak clearly and at normal volume.

**Using NixClaw away from home** — The default setup uses your local network. For remote access, you can either use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) (add an ATS exception in Info.plist for HTTP over Tailscale IPs) or expose your gateway via [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) for HTTPS access from anywhere.

**Background audio stops after a while** — iOS may suspend background audio if no sound is playing. The app uses background audio mode to stay alive, but extended silence may cause iOS to reclaim resources. Speak or tap the screen periodically to keep the session active.

For DAT SDK issues, see the [developer documentation](https://wearables.developer.meta.com/docs/develop/) or the [discussions forum](https://github.com/facebook/meta-wearables-dat-ios/discussions).
